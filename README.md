# Vanguard Perk HUD Animation
A simple script that adds a HUD Animation everytime you get a perk
The animation plays just like it shows on Vanguard Zombies

## Installation
Download vgperkhudanims.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using vgperkhudanims_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
